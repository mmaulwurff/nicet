nicet, nice tetris with text graphics

In normal mode (default) it works like usual tetris game with one additional feature: best suitable block. Summonning it costs 20 points. It can help you in difficult situation.
In lazy mode, all blocks are best suitable. No next block preview is available in this mode.

	Command line options:

[-s speed] - set game speed (from 1 to 10)
[-l] - play in lazy mode

	Game controls:

Left and right arrows: move current falling block
Down arrow: move block down
Up arrow: rotate block clockwise
Space: rotate block anticlockwise
b: (in normal mode only) summon best suitable block
p: pause and resume game
Q: quit game

	Scores:

1 line terminated: 1 point
2 lines terminated: 4 points
3 lines terminated: 8 points
4 lines terminated: 16 points

	Run notes:
libncurses5 should be installed

	Compile notes:

*nix:
gcc -lncurses -o nicet.bin
(libncurses5-dev should be installed)

For MS Windows users, take a look at PDCurses library. Maybe it will work instead of ncurses.
